This is the source for the Lasers game, written by Jarrett Billingsley for the
PittGeeks Third Annual 24-Hour Game Coding Competition.  It's a game for the
Nintendo DS, written in C++.

To compile it, you'll need devkitARM (http://devkitpro.org/).  It was compiled
with release 25 of the toolkit.  Once you have that installed, you should be
able to just "make" in the root directory.

To run it, you can try using a DS emulator.  iDeaS has issues with the touch-
screen, which seems like a grievous bug.  DeSmumE (ffs why do they all have
such weird capitalization) actually seems to work fine.  The best option is of
course to run it on an actual DS.  I'll leave it to you to find out how to do
that.
